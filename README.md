Clone of website at that domain, since it is broken.

It's hosted on github pages, and the domain is managed through godaddy.

Now live at: 
`http://www.deborahdenenfeld.com/`

`http://deborahdenenfeld.com/` redirects to the `www` one.

`https` is broken at the moment, probably something on godaddy or github that needs to be configured.

The original problem was that there was some service didn't get started when the server started so now there are all these error messages all over the page. Also, the blog doesn't load but she said she doesn't mind losing the blog content.

Here is the web archive of it, the earliest version doesn't have the MySQL error message:

[https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.deborahdenenfeld.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.deborahdenenfeld.com/)
