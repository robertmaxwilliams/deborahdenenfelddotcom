<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" --><h1>Spiritual Retreats and Team Building</h1>
<p>Have you ever considered how dance can be a tool for spiritual growth? Have you noticed the sense of community that builds within a group who dances together? How vulnerability leads to mutual respect and connection? How lessons that come with learning a dance can be applied to life lessons? Allow me to lead your group in discovering new connections and personal insights through dance, introspection, nature, journaling and sharing.</p>
<p>So much of being able to function successfully in any group setting depends on how one feels about themselves and how they treat others. Awareness, consciousness, open-heartedness and building inner peace so outward work can continue. Explore these concepts in the context of learning new dances.</p>
<p>Designed with your input and needs in mind, let me lead your group to new levels of respect, cooperation and functionality to achieve your long-range goals. Experience all this in a safe, fun environment.</p>
<p>Here are some comments from participants of a six-hour retreat I led called &ldquo;English Country Dance As A Means to Peace and Justice.&rdquo; The retreat was held for the Peace and Justice Committee of a church at the beginning of their year of service together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our experience at the direction of such a wonderfully gifted Caller helped me to appreciate how groups can work - trusting the process, valuing others, risking our own vulnerability - to effect a positive outcome. Thank you, Deborah, for a day well spent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw dance as a metaphor for life in quite the way I do now. I am connected to these people in a meaningful way, and it wasn&rsquo;t painful - it was fun. Thank you for being willing to share your own spirituality with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a way to get to know folks in such a short time. We could not do committees for a year and be so acquainted with those on the committee. Thank you, thank you, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day and interaction with each other while dancing has got me really excited about working together as a group to tackle small and large issues. Today helped me realize I made the right decision to join this committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Group dance is such a perfect analogy for life. This experience left me with a lot to think about. I feel it will help me as co-leader of environmental concerns. The day was great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great experience of growth, group dynamics and development!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day, this retreat was amazing. Nothing I expected but everything I needed. Wonderful metaphor / analogy for our group dynamic and for life itself. Deborah&rsquo;s patience with the group was amazing and it was wonderful to watch the dance unfold. It was important for me to hear that people learn through their own experience. Sometimes a nudge, nod, firm grasp will assist someone better than me saying anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not looking forward to spending a full day on a retreat, but I had such a wonderful experience; it was over before I was ready to stop dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I truly believe the lessons I learned today through dance will help me better myself in my own personal life. I learned very valuable lessons today that I am excited to put into action with all different types of relationships in my life. Thank you for an amazing day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dance and the image of community - creating something beautiful together - had never been in my mind together. What did we create together today? Hopefully, we learned to work (dance) together, and maybe we can dance together all year. I know it made me learn to dance with a couple of folks I would not usually have danced (worked) with. Hopefully, my mind and heart will be open enough all year to work (dance) with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned the importance of listening - to the instructions and to the music. It&rsquo;s important for me to remember that it&rsquo;s not all up to me. The example of others will help the whole &ldquo;dance&rdquo; turn out beautifully, even if we have missteps at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to disagree with someone later, after we&rsquo;ve had this learning experience. Now I know you better and we can laugh about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deborah is a patient, compassionate person who made learning so much fun!&rdquo;</p>
